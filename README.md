# Topic_modelling_LDA
In this project topic modelling has been done on a corpus created by webscraping newspaper articles. For creating the topic models we have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation. This is a probabilistic model, in which topics are assumed to be distributions of words over  a fixed vocabulary and  a document is a mixture of topics. The probabilistic graphical model describing the generative process can be found in, http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/BleiLafferty2009.pdf. 
We have used NLTK, Gensim libraries in this project. 
        The topic modelling has been done in the Jupyter notebook, topic_model_lda.ipynb. This can be viewed through Nbviewer here, https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rajarshipal15/Topic_modelling_LDA/blob/main/topic_model_lda.ipynb#topic=0&lambda=0.22&term=
