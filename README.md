# Topic_modelling_LDA
In this project topic modelling has been done on a corpus created by webscraping newspaper articles. For creating the topic models we have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation. This is a probabilistic model, in which topics are assumed to be distributions of words from   a fixed vocabulary and  a document is a mixture of topics. The probabilistic graphical model descrbing the generative process can be found in, http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/BleiLafferty2009.pdf. 
We have used NLTK, Gensim libraries in this project.
